# Uno Card Drag-Drop Example

Maybe one day it will be a complete Uno card game, but for now I'm experimenting with Angular Material's [DragDrop CDK](https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview).

## Development server

Run `npm start` to run the project locally.  I like to add `-o` to the script that runs so it will also open a new tab for you at localhost:4200, so it will do that for you.

## Notes

The YouTube video [Drag and Drop with the Angular CDK - What's New in v7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1CrWLGxQPk) was a big help in starting this off, and coding along with the video in it's entirety saved in branch *"initial-tutorial"*.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.24.
